# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a GitHub reusable action that runs CloudFormation linting using cfn-lint. The action will accept a template path as input and provide comprehensive linting results with proper error handling and GitHub Step Summary integration. This reusable action will allow teams to standardize CloudFormation template validation across multiple repositories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use a reusable GitHub action to lint CloudFormation templates, so that I can standardize template validation across multiple repositories without duplicating workflow code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is called with a template-path input THEN the system SHALL accept the input parameter and use it for linting
2. WHEN the action is referenced in a workflow THEN the system SHALL be accessible as a reusable action from other repositories
3. WHEN the action completes THEN the system SHALL provide consistent output format across all repositories using it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action to validate CloudFormation template paths and provide clear error messages, so that I can quickly identify and fix path-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template path is provided THEN the system SHALL construct the full path using github.workspace
2. WHEN the template file does not exist at the specified path THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the full path and exit with code 1
3. WHEN the template file exists THEN the system SHALL proceed with linting and display the template name being processed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the action to run cfn-lint with proper error handling, so that I can get reliable linting results without workflow failures due to tool issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cfn-lint is executed THEN the system SHALL use parseable format for consistent output
2. WHEN cfn-lint runs THEN the system SHALL capture both stdout and stderr output
3. WHEN cfn-lint completes THEN the system SHALL preserve the original exit code for proper workflow decision making
4. WHEN cfn-lint fails THEN the system SHALL not cause premature workflow termination during output processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive GitHub Step Summary reporting, so that I can easily review linting results without digging through raw logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting completes successfully THEN the system SHALL add a success summary with template name to GitHub Step Summary
2. WHEN linting finds issues THEN the system SHALL add detailed error information including exit code explanation to GitHub Step Summary
3. WHEN linting output is available THEN the system SHALL format the output in code blocks within the summary
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include cfn-lint exit code meanings for user reference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline maintainer, I want the action to handle different cfn-lint exit codes appropriately, so that my workflows can make informed decisions based on linting severity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cfn-lint exits with code 0 THEN the system SHALL report success and continue workflow
2. WHEN cfn-lint exits with non-zero codes THEN the system SHALL exit with the same code to maintain pipeline behavior
3. WHEN displaying exit codes THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of what each code means (0: No issues, 2: Warnings, 4: Errors, 8: Invalid CLI, 16: Fatal errors)
4. WHEN linting fails THEN the system SHALL display both summary information and detailed output before exiting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the action to be properly structured as a GitHub reusable action, so that it can be easily consumed by other repositories with proper metadata and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the action is created THEN the system SHALL include proper action.yaml metadata with name, description, and input definitions
2. WHEN the action is used THEN the system SHALL accept template-path as a required input parameter
3. WHEN the action is published THEN the system SHALL be consumable using standard GitHub Actions syntax (uses: owner/repo@version)
4. WHEN the action runs THEN the system SHALL execute in a consistent shell environment with proper error handling
